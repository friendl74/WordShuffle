# WordShuffle
This is an old program I originally programmed in Amiga BASIC, that I've now recreated in Python.

What took me an evening to write before, writing the program in Python took around 40 minutes.
It was the investigating of how to shuffle letters in a string, which lead me to the import random library that shuffles
a list.  Just a matter of convert back and forth between string and list.

From what I recollect, when I wrote this code in Amiga BASIC, I did coded the shuffle part using 2 arrays.  Python's random library
eased the process of writing this small program.
