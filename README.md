# WordShuffle
This is an old program that I originally programmed in Amiga BASIC, that I've now recreated in Python.

What took me an evening to write before, now writing the program in Python took around 30 minutes.
It was the investigating of how to shuffle letters in a string, which lead me to the import random library that shuffles list elements.
It was then just a matter of converting back and forth between a string and a list.

From what I recollect, when I wrote this code in Amiga BASIC, I did code the shuffle part using 2 arrays.  Python's random library
eased the process of writing this small program.
